# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game to be played against the computer. To add a creative spin on the game, I redesigned it into a fairy tale theme as Knight Princess Dragon, with similar gameplay. The aim of this project was to begin practicing and applying my JavaScript knowledge.

The project was referenced from The Odin Project Foundations curriculum: [Part 1](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) and [Part 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors)

## How to Play

The player is prompted to make their move by clicking one of three buttons. Meanwhile, the computer will randomly make its own selection for its move. This makes up one round of the game. The results of the round will be displayed in the box above the buttons. Whoever wins the round gets a point that is added to the score counter. The first player to earn five points wins the game. If the player wants to play again, they must refresh the page.

## Development Process

1. I started by making a simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors that allows the user to play the game from the browser console. This involved coding the basic logic of the game.
2. After successfully getting the game to work, I planned and designed the user interface by sketching the layout in a OneNote file, including text, buttons, displays, color gradients, images, and other relevant elements. This is when I came up with the idea to reform the game into Knight Princess Dragon.
3. After the planning stage, I rewrote some portions of the code to remove all references to console.log, and built the GUI based off of the design. This included some rework of the functions to include DOM methods that would display content on the page.

## Project Status

In process -- Although the functionality of the game is working correctly, some design additions are in the process of being completed.

## What I learned
* Using the DOM to manipulate elements and styles
* Implementing event listeners to listen and respond to user actions
* Applying knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals to code a working game
* Refactoring code and breaking down larger portions of the program into smaller functions
* Adding media queries to accommodate a wider variety of screen sizes
* Using programming best practices to improve code structure and readability
